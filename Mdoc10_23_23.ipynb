    "**the ideas are the easy part**\n",
    "\n",
    "external \"conciousness\" model produce correct behavior? \n",
    "\n",
    "GAN's for world models. no rent free world representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "how to get two agents to communicate world states and take actions from that update world state to cut back on trail and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "genetic algorithms using two parents + variation?\n",
    "\n",
    "since deep Q tries to find a function approximation for a policy, have a metafunction use an attention mechanism to try and match what environment it is in and what approximation function should be used THis way it can learn to do many things in many different domains.+ threshold for higher RL overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "in thinking fast and slow, is the \"thinking fast\" kind of akin to letting the model run and then updating the \"thinking slow\" model later? i dont think it applies but I do think the brain does something kind of like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "stateful RL needs the state to be in the replay buffer so when the experience is sampled the policy is set to the policies state when the experience happens. closest I can think of is memories evoking emotions. I realize I'm pigeon holing but it is interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "finding a way to add an autoencoder to RL would probably help sample efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "understand how to mask environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "if Deep Q-Networks are finding a function for approximate Q values I'm assuming it is pretty domain specific, it doesn't seem you can throw that function at another domain and espect it work without recalibrating th function to deal with the domain shift. These functions also need a metafunction that creates functions to deal with domain specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "humans seem to do a dual exploration + rewards based learning depending on the environment context, maybe good to have param to increase what rewards one prioritizes. Or consider them two different agents under a master agent who can domain switch. like as a kid I liked to play and explore, but I ended up listening to parents because the rewards (or punishments for not listening) were greater than exploring, of course there were times I prioritized exploration to the anger of my parents and loss of future happiness (rewards?) there.\n",
    "\n",
    "it seems RL desperately needs a way to split domain contexts and switch between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "what is a \"good policy\"? a policy is just a function for the environment right? or is it something more? DQN is attemption to generate a function that can output an appoximate Q-value given a state in that environment. and usually based on that an action is taken. can all our brain does be reduce down to lossy function modeling and action execution (with a lot of complexity)? ignoring the philosophical, if all DQN's do is make a function for estimation based on an environment (domain) then finding research on domain joining and connecting it together with deepl RL should give a very versitile agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "and if it is a an action function for an environment that DQN's are using then somehow being able to pre-model that function or finding a way to ad skip connections could greatly increase sample efficiency. We humans I imagine have something like this, everything we learn when we're grown seems like fine-tuning to me, but domain specific sub RL agent creation. I think autoencoders are the bridge there somehow, to pass general domain information onto a subdomain then fine-tune from there within the same general \"agent\". if we can add on parralelism we get a bot that can walk and chew gum at the same time. then just make a threshold where if there is a prediction error the main RL head focuses attention on it and resolves it by uppring the learning rate or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "resolving this seems to be what I need to work on, and I need to create a robot with enough versitile actions available e.g a basic arm and wheels to do it. I wonder how feasably I think this be when I actually really dive deep into RL, regardless it will need to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**the versitile robot**: like a simple bot to get drinks, learn peoples names, learn anything really. it would need a master RL agent (combined with attention mechanisms?) to identify what domain it is in and either use an already trained sub RL agent for that domain or generate a new one, the generated new one would idealy be trained by RLHF. if there is a prediction error it trys to resolve it internally or then gets help.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Needs connecting\n",
    "a lot of boosting techniques make things that look at relationships that move together, see local response normalization and SE blocks in CNN's\n",
    "\n",
    "neighboring values are used in a lot of places for estimating a value, neighbors count for a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "seems like there are two things in deep learning, generating functions and generating probability distributions, I'm sure there has been a way to combine these, or they are already combined. Maybe I'll run across a paper like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan after the book\n",
    "start reading through papers field by field and getting better, until you have a solid idea of what SOTA is in a certain subfield, what they are working on, and where they might be headed., write a report on it for the blog. Do this every year so you don't fall behind.\n",

    "\n",
    "humans also seem to have a local response normalization, how many siblings go into the same field as each other in the long run? life seems to like diverse output.\n",
    "\n",
    "&humans seem to do reassignment of credit for bad actions in therapy, recontextualizing the \"supposed\" bad actions to the (maybe) \"real\" bad actions. also short vs long term rewards are given sometimes through parents or teachers (good things come to those who wait) or the enviroment (touching a cat in the wrong place it scratches you), humans seem to usually give sparse long term rewards and the environment usually seems to give short term rewards (with excepts of course)\n",
